# Object Oriented Classes

**Well, Better late than never**!Started logging from Day 5, so expect previous notes to be incomplete.

## How we landed over here 
In this COVID-19 situation, we were struggling hard to keep up with the online classes and had given up on our usual pen and paper method of taking notes. So we came up with this, helping our fellow classmates who struggle harder to keep thier eyes open suring the lectures. Charity begins at home ,LOL.

## What is Inside
This Repository contains what our professor has been teaching us about the very famous Object Oriented Programming language [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/). 

## About Us
We're the 5th Semester Students of the Computer Science and Engineering Department of [AOT](https://aot.edu.in/) and we thought of studying how a CSE student should, eyes on the screen and fingers on the keys.
