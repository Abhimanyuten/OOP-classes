# Object Oriented Programming Day 3 Notes

## Class

A Class is a group of object which has common properties. It is a template on blueprint from which objects are created. Classes are Blueprints.  s
A Java Class Contains:  

- Variables
- Methods
- Constructors
- Blocks
- Nested Class
- Interface  

## Object

An object is an identifiable entity that has state and behaviour.  
e.g. A Pen is an object; with colour and name as state, it is used to write, so, writing is behaviour.  
It is an instance of a class.

`new` is a keyword use to create a new object.  


## Lab Questions:

- Create a Class Animal then within the class create 3 objects of animals having names A1, A2 and A3, where A1 and A3 will point to the same object. Then Display the object name.
- Calculate Factorial of a number using recursion by taking command line input.
- Find the largest palindrome in an array taken at runtime
  
## Homework:

- Write a program to print all triplets that form the given sum.
- WAP to remove all duplicates from the given input arrays. And also print the sum of the distinct elements.  

  ```
  For example:
  Inp : {1,2,3,4}  
        {4,5,6,7}  
  Out : {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}  
  Also print the sum  
  ```
